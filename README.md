# Hi, I'm Damon Pickett
 I'm a front-end developer and AI specialist. Who are you? Is there anything I can help you with?

# The Why
I code because I love to build. When I'm building it's like I step outside of time. I'm also an excellent communicator. You know when you call a call centre and an automated message says "Your call may be monitored for quality and training purposes"? Well I used to be the guy monitoring calls for quality and training purposes. I've spent countless hours evaluating people's interactions. So I want to combine my passion for building with my skills in communication to create value for others.

# Projects
Here are the projects I'm most proud of:
- [MacTA](https://github.com/damonpickett/macta): MacTA is a command-line application that uses GPT-3 to generate instructions for using the MacOS terminal. MacTA makes it easy to stay disciplined and use your terminal as opposed to your finder. You just type in `macta` and then describe the task you want to perform. MacTA then uses GPT-3 to generate clear, concise instructions.
- [buge](https://github.com/damonpickett/buge): buge is a command-line application that uses GPT-3 to explain error codes and make suggestions for resolving them. It allows the user to simply paste their error code into their terminal and let buge do the research.
- [Whitsteen Project](https://github.com/damonpickett/whitsteen-project): This is a mock NFT project based on the artwork of my friend Whitsteen. It's a React app which uses the Rinkeby(Ethereum) testnet for blockchain transactions. This project was super fun because I got to design it around Whitsteen's artwork.
